This repository contains the python implementation of different computer vision algorithms. 


## Harris corner detection
- High computational cost
- Slow
- Cross correlation on image patches is not as descriptive as more modern approaches
- Harris descriptors are not invariant to scale or rotation
- Choice of patch size affect the results
